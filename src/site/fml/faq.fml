            <question>Why was the Mojo project created?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Well, this allows <a href="http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/mojo/members">a bunch of people</a>,
                    not necessarily involved with the Maven project, to come along and build
                    some plugins. They are free to look after just that plugin, though I hope that they'll get involved in the
                    community of people here and work on other plugins as well as help maintain the common infrastructure like the
                    site.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Maven plugins may also be developed here because they are not compatible with the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/">Apache license</a>. Plugin
                    authors may choose to use other licenses (BSD, GPL, MPL ...) to license their work or may be forced to because
                    of the nature of the plugin and its dependencies. These plugin authors are responsible for working with their
                    plugins license but the mailing lists are a great place to get help if people get confused on what can or can
                    not be done within the mojo project.

            <question>How can we communicate?</question>
            <answer>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the <a href="mail-lists.html">mailing list</a> where possible as more people can get involved and so an archive is available.</li>
                    <li>If it is specific to a plugin, prefix the subject with the plugin name, e.g. <code>[jalopy]</code>.</li>
                    <li>Use <a href="irc.html">IRC</a> for realtime discussion.
                        Try and summarise and send it to the list if there was some decisions were made there.</li>

        <faq id="what-is-the-sandbox">
            <question>What is the sandbox?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    The sandbox is used to "incubate" new plugins. Sandbox plugins will not be released to the repositories and if you
                    are interested in trying it out you will probably have to build it from source.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    All new code should be put in the sandbox so we can make sure that the plugin uses the correct code style,
                    that is has proper documentation and generally has the expected quality.

        <faq id="where-is-sandbox">
            <question>Where is the sandbox?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Most plugins have sites published and linked from the <a href="plugins.html">Mojo Plugin List</a>.
                    Others can be found in the <a href="https://svn.codehaus.org/mojo/trunk/sandbox/">SVN repository</a>.
